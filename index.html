    <p>Being in a world of <em>technology</em> and <em>tecnology</em> <strong>improving</strong> as days goes by made me choose programing.I like creating something out of <strong>nothing</strong>. I like building things people use. It's amazing to type up some code, press a button, and suddenly thousands of people on the Internet are playing with it.Programing allows you to build make adjustments and see the effects. It makes one be creative which makes someone to think and introduce something new to thid world of technology</p>
